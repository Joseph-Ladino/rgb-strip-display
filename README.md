# What is this
this repo is for displaying animations on my rgb strip, it contains a nodejs script and an arduino sketch

# Why is the number 148 hardcoded everywhere
that's how many leds i have, as two broke off because of me being careless

# Why is half the node script for one animation
about that... i was trying to do a thing and just dont feel like removing/replacing/finishing it yet

# i hate you
:D
